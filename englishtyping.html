                        <option value="Pressure of successful recruitment on organizations is making the HRs adopt modern practices to ensure fairness and efficiency in the hiring process. From identifying the right channel to source the desired candidate and potentially fast-tracking them through proper recruitment and onboarding procedures, HRs are looking at optimizing the entire process and cost. A successful and organized recruitment procedure can assist in finding a talent aligned with the brand values, culture, and purpose. Due to the onset of the pandemic, the majority of hiring processes have moved to virtual space, integrating advanced technologies. Organizations are deploying new-age strategies that not only expedite the hiring process but also eliminate bias in assessing candidates and provide insights for data-driven decision-making. Adopting a digitised approach Technology has become an indispensable part of every function and it has replaced the manual process with automated ones. Similarly, talent managers also need to adopt an automated approach when it comes to hiring with efficiency. Embedding technology tools can replace their repeated mundane tasks without requiring their valuable time and skills to be wasted on manual execution. Unfortunately, several organizations still require their employees to spend hours completing time-consuming tasks. By automating the recruitment process, talent managers can spend more time analyzing the candidates data and finding the ones with requisite skills. Expanding the horizon to remote workers Prior to the pandemic, it was hard for organizations to think about having full-time remote workers. However, the overnight shifting of office work to virtual space has settled the remote work challenges and concurred that having a remote workforce is possible. As a result, talent managers now get a larger pool of potential candidates because geography no longer remains a barrier. In addition, it also contributes to an organisation diversity, equity and inclusion policy by having employees belonging to different territories and cultures. Establishing a leadership culture Promoting a sense of ownership in employees breeds leaders of tomorrow. Hence, designing a strategy that empowers the culture of leadership within the company can help talent managers attract better talent in the industry. Superior talent in an organisation gives new wings to business. This can be nurtured by providing innovative leadership training to employees who can further provide a competitive edge to the organisation. Therefore, exhibiting ownership culture and high-performance variability can prove to be a game-changer in building a stronger workforce. Considering internal mobility Depending on external knowledge and sources remains top of the mind of talent managers while finding the much-needed skills. However, this strategy can be time-consuming as well as expensive. Talent managers often overlook the internal promotions or benefit of internal mobility in filling up open positions. As a robust hiring solution, talent managers must leverage the existing relationship in their existing employee base that can accelerate productivity with much efficiency. As per the data companies that leverage internal mobility reportedly retained employees for 5.4 years. Adopting employee flexibility No candidate wants to join a workplace where employees feel exhausted. Talent managers must explore ways to offer flexibility.">Para 1</option>

Following this policy Gandhi supported the Khilafat Movement, a divisive movement which turned into a communal movement culminating into genocide of Hindus in Malabar. It is noteworthy that Khilafat Movement was opposed by Jinnah whereas Mauling Abu Kalama Azad had supported it. The genocide of hapless Hindus prompted Dr. Hedge war conceives an organization of Hindus. This led to the formation of RSS in 1925. Now that RSS has grown into a force to reckon with, the present Chief of RSS, Dr. Mohan Bhagwat has embarked on the mission to bring the Muslim Community into the mainstream which Congress did not do in pursuit of its narrow political interest or rather alienated the community. With the response he is getting from the intelligentsia and certain sections of the Muslim Community, it is hoped, the bond between the Hindus & Muslims will be strengthened, who have for generations lived harmoniously. Today, with the complexity of designs that we witness worldwide, a digital uprising is very critical. As architects and designers, we must actively invest in newer technology and innovations with in the construction industry to allow stakeholders to save time and money and go paperless in the long run, moving towards environmental sustainability. Modern-day structures are a combination of various interconnected elements and resultants of complex calculations. Ensuring this momentous task is carried out with utmost precision requires a blend of competencies and digital aid. The adoption of various technologies in construction works can enable professionals to save time, improve the quality of work, reduce costs, focus on safety parameters, and increase profit margins. Digitisation can also streamline business models and practices with proper tracking measures, thereby providing transparency and allowing us to collect data, track materials and working hours for effective planning. Incorporating technology also boosts productivity, increases efficiency and reduces project delivery time as communication on projects improves, reducing the scope for confusion and errors. In the present day, continually evolving technology has further strengthened the usage of digital tools such as BIM a popular tool with integrated design practices. This has enabled architecture and engineering to streamline and improve on the lines of quality, accuracy and innovation. Additionally, various 3D integrated design and analysis is software have made construction operations easier by carrying out complex simulations. As a result, such software and tools have become widely popular among architects and designers. Digitised Operations Embracing the Change The construction industry consists of many organizations that are either unprepared for or overwhelmed by the magnitude of new and emerging technologies. The increasing desire for organizations to switch to digital operations is further reinforced by their intent to limit the usage of resources such as paper. This saves enormous printing costs, precious time and storage in a modern-day workspace. In addition, information management.">Para 2</option>
                        <option value="And knowledge transfer have become a swift process with digitised operations. But, the major challenge the construction industry faces today is smoother communication amongst different stakeholders in the timely completion of projects. Projects are dynamic and often require numerous changes and modifications throughout their lifecycle, especially from the schematic to the completion stage. While we have all progressed towards utilising digital platforms for smooth communication and managing documentation and timeline through various platforms, there still needs to be a seamless integration of everything that is dynamic and acts as a way of communication amongst different stakeholders. This calls for a dire need for digital transformation in the construction sector, especially post-pandemic, with a digitally enabled workforce. Globally, the adoption of technology has enabled firms offering design and construction services to identify inefficiencies, curate an implementation strategy and employ the right personnel. By incorporating advanced technology, integrated practices offering design and engineering consultation seek to increase profitability, streamline processes, reduce project risks, and bring efficiency in their design coordination by pre-empting clashes in design and providing value addition to the designed product. Boosting productivity with technology In the era of pursuing integrated operations, collaboration becomes paramount. Architects use technology platforms such as BIM, allowing effective collaboration with engineers and contractors regarding the designs of projects. With the growing popularity of BIM modeling, using 3D modeling software has become a must for Government projects in certain countries and is increasingly being requested for private projects of all sizes. In regards to ensuring a hazard-free work environment, Augmented Reality (AR)provides an overlay of digital information on top of the real world. Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) allows software access to phones, thus reducing the usage of high-end laptops and desktops for real-time updates. Additionally, Virtual Reality (VR) enables designers to model structures and simulate them as per various real-world scenarios. Using drones for inspections and surveys cuts down the time involved and the usage of resources. Similarly, the Internet of Things (Iota) manages a plethora of technology and optimizes the use of resources with effective planning and connecting everyone on the team. The future of the Indian built environment has tremendous potential to develop complex structures in challenging environments with diverse social and climatic conditions. The economic narrative on projects must allocate room for enabling state-of-the-art technology on large-scale projects. With multiple stakeholders involved in a project, time management becomes a necessity making collaboration the key to operating in the industry. Technology, when used to its utmost potential, can enable communication to increase between the field and the office. Additionally, real-time data allows plans, permits and other documents to get submitted and approved faster, ensuring supreme project delivery. Therefore, a switch to digital operations with all the costs involved seems a justified move in the industrial context. To win the race of accelerated digitalization, organizations are constantly evolving their hiring strategies. As the crisis unfolds, these organizations are buckling down to refine their hiring process and win the war of talent. Further, the tremendous.">Para 3</option>
                        <option value="Regarding the impact of automation, the increase in productivity of manufacturing processes with declining manpower demands cannot be ruled out. The increasing intervention of machines in the handling of various activities in all sectors contributing to the economy is bound to affect the manual requirements adversely. However, this is opening new vistas for developing automated and intelligent systems with the involvement of human intelligence and efforts. Challenges The collective endeavour for getting things done using machines and their automatic is culminating in intelligent digital systems with the ability to remain productive without human involvement. There is an obvious replacement of many persons by infusing artificial intelligence into digital manufacturing systems. The loss of jobs on account of such transformations is prominently upon the shop floor jobs. Robots replacing humans for doing certain tasks are ubiquitous in various industries. For example, automation in the food industry, agriculture, construction sector, health sector for operating healthcare machines, medical robots, multipurpose robots, autonomous vehicles, unmanned operations, etc. are gradually eliminating the manpower requirements. To elaborate further, let us realize how automation has replaced manpower in the food industry where technological advancements have paved the way for mechanized preparation of ingredients for cooking, recipe-based automatic cooking, machines for cleaning utensils, robots for lifting and placing items, services like waiters, etc. Why doctors are required for the diagnosis of disease and prescribe a line of treatment if a similar symptom-based diagnosis is carried out using an interactive software application? Hospitals are heavily relying on technology in extending health services. The reliance on washing machines, mopping machines, cleaning machines, surveillance systems, etc. has undoubtedly eased life and reduced dependence on domestic helps. The complete agriculture value chain and agriculture business is changing on the premise of low labor input and high yield using technological support. In the education sector, the new norm of online blended teaching and self-oriented learning is likely to incur a huge loss of jobs across the world. These are a few instances to perceive the ensuing challenges from the ongoing automation. This has yielded in increasing production of robots for specific purposes by robot manufacturers and the deployment of industrial robots is increasing every day. In the specific context of India which is blessed with demographic dividend and has an abundance of young population, the reports indicating the likelihood of loss of 69% of jobs due to automation is discomforting for policymakers. Declining labor demand for medium-skill occupations and imbalance in demand for low and high-skill occupations emanating into exacerbating wage disproportionateness is perturbing for the nations having a mammoth size of population seeking jobs. The situation is equally distressing in developed economies too like those of China, the USA, Japan, South Korea, etc. Opportunity: Automation has effectuated in cyber-physical systems as part of Industry 4.0.

                        <option value="Therefore, to remain efficient, competitive and sustainable, businesses must invest in modernising and empowering their legal departments. What, then, is legal transformation? Introduction of technology in legal departments also benefits the business whole, from ensuring business continuity to complying with laws, improving business environment, finalizing contracts, protecting business interests, etc. Hence, many legal departments have undergone a transformation to improve their own operations. Legal Transformation is amalgamating people, processes and data under one umbrella to support legal operations and to significantly improve the way legal departments function. It also enables the organisation to function effortlessly in the new external environment of the day by unifying the various sub functions of the legal department and integrating it with the rest of the organisation. Legal transformation typically involves three steps. Shifting from manual to digital operations across the entire legal function. Digitising and automating cross functional and external coordination. mplementing a system of centralised data, document handling and workflows The key advantage of digitisation and technology in the legal function is more efficient, easier, faster and simpler operational processes enabling faster yet simpler business. Technology enables people to connect faster and collaborate better, enabling simpler ways to doing business. This involves, in a birds eye view, connecting all the constituent functions of corporate legal departments in a single platform, called Enterprise Legal Management ELM. This is a system which connects the entire contract management, matter management, compliances, legal spend etc. seamlessly, while also integrating these with the organisational systems. Outlining and planning the change It is imperative to chart the current status of the processes, operations and data formats of the organisation are they fully manual, or have some basic automation been done? What are the interconnections with other departments and external parties? The organisational strategy and current challenges have also to be considered. These two will enable the charting of the precise steps to be undertaken, a prioritised list of the pain points of the organisation. Prioritisation is essential so that the change is smooth, and does not hamper current operations. For example, if the key challenge is the back end onboarding of new partners is taking time in a fast moving unicorn startup, the first step could be a savvy rapid online onboarding processes including, self service contracting; this enables smooth and fast onboarding of all stakeholders. Alternatively, the pain point could be regulatory compliance in a highly regulated industry. This is the second level of transformation, wherein the key pain point has been addressed now the task is to proceed and incorporate technology throughout the legal function. In the example above, it could include standard templatised contracts, documents, a centralised repository of all contracts and documents, as well as Real time online Compliance and Entity management systems to ensure the company is fully compliant and up to date with the regulations meaning further risk reduction and business agility.

The first is the realisation that we are not all powerful. A tiny organism with a propensity to spread and breed with frightening speed took away two years of our lives already and there is no letting how many more it will claim. The second wave showed people who hitherto considered themselves as privileged that all their money, power and influence could do nothing to save their loved ones, as the deadly microbe rampaged through their bodies. Sadly, it led to only a momentary humility and realisation of our own mortality. Governments round the world woke up when Delta went on a killing spree and have now tried to provide infrastructure to cope with future virus assaults. But even the US which has far more advanced and well funded healthcare systems also faltered as hospitals were swamped by unprecedented numbers of patients and extremely high death rates. So, the second realisation is that we cannot let our guard down as we did barely two months after the tears had dried from all the losses of April and May.

And then it came back, albeit in a milder form, that has led to some epidemiologists to claim Omicron will deliver the herd immunity and the ultimate natural vaccination against Covid. But that is based on current evidence on the virus; no one is certain that the worst is truly over this time. We can only hope that good sense will prevail on the virus, as it seems too much to expect that the same good judgment from most of us humans. Hopefully, my little grand niece current familiarity with flu jabs and Covid tests will wear off with time. Whether Covid was engineered in a Wuhan laboratory or inadvertently swarmed out of a wet market there, the fact that an entire generation is growing up under the spectre of fear because of it, should not be forgotten. The powerful and haunting phrase Never again once again has a relevance akin to what it came to encapsulate after the Holocaust. A happy new decade to all readers! Let erase all the pathetic 2020 and 2021 memories of the virus with Greek letter variants and wish each other a happy 2022. Any new year is associated with two traumatic things a hangover from the party the night before and the scary R word resolutions. Omicron restrictions limited the parties and saved us the hangovers. However, we still are stuck with the latter resolutions. We enter 2022 heart in mouth, hoping the Omicron wave remains mild, worried it will turn severe. But although we had to dial down the partying a second time in a row, we are in a sweeter spot than on New Year Day 2021. India now has a bunch of vaccines in its arsenal and is headed towards the three dose benchmark of full vaccination, with breakthrough drugs also on their way thanks to the jugalbandi of global science and domestic manufacturing. Second, harsh lessons served by the summer of 2021 should hopefully hold governments and political parties in good stead. If they do, Omicron probably won take a tragic toll like Delta did, or rather was allowed to. 2022 season of assembly elections must not meet the same superspreader fate as 2021. It requires EC actually enforcing the Covid safety template it had drawn way back for the Bihar 2020 election rallies, with political parties 100% cooperation. Our other big wish for elections this time is that they ditch Aurangzeb and Shiva, Nehru and Jinnah, even Gandhi and Gods. Vicious battles over those long dead and gone do nothing to improve health and education today. Indeed, they make for dangerous sidetracking. All advances religion and caste make at the polls are at the cost of visas. The young need jobs not polarized history lessons. The economy is anyway hanging on Omicron razor edge. Weak consumption and hardening inflation already demand a tough balancing act from RBI and Go, so keeping the virus in check is critical to continuing economic recovery.">Para 9</option>

Today, there is a clearly identifiable change in the way healthcare services are being delivered and perceived in India. As the saying goes, adversity has truly brought out the potential that the Indian healthcare sector has. The pandemic has been hard for even the best and the most organized healthcare systems in the world, and this is where the quality and quantity of effort put in by the medical professionals and support staff throughout India has been incredible. We might have lost some battles, but we have been quite successful in the war against the contagion. Despite the impact of the second wave and as the country has crossed the one billion plus vaccine doses landmark there have been some highly encouraging takeaways from the healthcare operations in 2021. These are trends and developments that will serve as the mainstay of future of healthcare in India and transform the way things are perceived by patients and caregivers alike. One of the biggest and most heartening developments being witnessed is the emergence of collaborative and patient centric healthcare delivery. Conventionally, Indian healthcare sector operated in silos such as hospitals, private doctors clinics, diagnostic labs, pharmacies and so on. With each service vertical focusing on its own area of operation, there were plenty of gaps as far as coverage and quality of care is concerned. However, the pandemic has taught us that there is a need to integrate these different elements of healthcare and ensure that the patient is able to access care and treatment at through the right channel at the right time. This requires substantial use of technology such that patient data is owned by them and is portable. The NDHM has set out on a journey of providing such a framework for our healthcare ecosystem and this should deliver results in the coming years. In the meantime, a number of healthtech companies have come in to create solutions that can help creating digital access to patients and providers.

			 <option value="From a reflective point of view, 2021 has been a year of great learning, capacity building and reorienting the roadmaps towards ensuring world class healthcare coverage across the country in the times to come. May the momentum continue! The north Indian town of Hardwar, where the Ganges River flows out of the Himalayas onto India vast plains, has been for centuries a destination for pilgrims. For three days in December, it also played host to what the Indian media has called a hate speech conclave, in which multiple speakers all dressed in saffron garb, the traditional signifier of sanctity in India called for Muslims and Christians in India to be killed. One hailed the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and exhorted Indian politicians, the army and every Hindu to pick up weapons and conduct a cleanliness drive. There was, he said, no solution apart from this. Even in a country that has turned worryingly majoritarian in recent years, such open promotion of genocide and ethnic cleansing should have set off alarms. It is not only tens of millions of minorities as well as India increasingly tenuous connection to liberal values that are at risk. The Indian state itself risks being undermined by its leaders tacit acceptance of religious vigilantism. India ruling Bharatiya Janata Party would not be the first political party to wink at ethno nationalist extremism among its followers. The states of Uttarakhand, where the town of Hardwar is located, and neighboring Uttar Pradesh from which Uttarakhand was split off two decades ago are due for elections in coming months. The BJP, in power in both states, might be tempted to think that heightened inter religious tension is a useful distraction from a struggling economy and the devastation caused by the Covid 19 pandemic. But India opposition parties have not pushed back strongly either. They are struggling to formulate a response to this sort of rhetoric that does not result in them being labeled anti Hindu. In parts of north India, the secularism guaranteed by India constitution has become so politically toxic that many politicians no longer seem able to defend the right of citizens to profess whatever faith they choose. As a consequence, the entire Indian political class seems increasingly complicit in enabling hate speech. The organizers of the Hardwar hatefest have already planned another for the Uttar Pradesh town of Aligarh, home to a government run university long known as a center of Indian Muslim scholarship. Tolerating such events is devastatingly shortsighted. Words have consequences, especially in a country with as awful a history of inter religious violence as India. Just last week, in the Sikh majority state of Punjab, two men accused of sacrilege were lynched by Sikh mobs. Punjab will also hold elections soon and Indian newspapers pointed out that most politicians condemned the alleged sacrilege but said little else. Elsewhere in India, Christmas services were interrupted by mobs and Santa Claus was burned in effigy, obviously. If India leaders want to see where.">Para 11</option>

In a particularly brutal example of mob violence this month, Priyantha Kumara, a Sri Lankan factory manager in the Pakistani town of Sialkot, was beaten, stoned and then set on fire by his own workers supposedly because he had committed blasphemy. Kumara worked in one of Sialkot many export focused garment factories; the city businessmen worry that if it gets a reputation for violence and sectarianism, their trade and investment partners will look elsewhere. National leaders should be no less concerned. Some analysts have suggested the US might seek to reorient its relationship with Pakistan toward boosting trade and increasing investment by American firms. That seems, to put it mildly, unlikely in a place where expatriate executives fear possible lynching. Practical considerations should shock India politicians into action, if moral ones don. The states that the Ganges flows through after passing Hardwar are India heartland and central to the BJP stranglehold on power in New Delhi. And yet the 300 million plus people who live there are according to the government own figures among the poorest and most deprived in the world. The current government of Uttar Pradesh has failed to improve matters: The state grew by only 2 a year over the BJP five year tenure and even prior to the pandemic underperformed the national average by 1.6 percentage points a year. To secure the future of this Gang etic plain, investment and trade will need to increase many times over. Economic transformation on such a scale cannot happen where the state fails to protect its citizens or society is fractured, xenophobic and violent. Nobody is going to invest billions in areas that appear vulnerable to religious civil war. Politicians may believe they can ride this tiger. Trying to distract voters with sectarian hatred, however, is a bit like concealing the lack of paint on your house by burning it down. Presenter Chandra Mahalanobis, the pioneer of statistics in India, was a key contributor to the five year planning process in independent India. He was not just a modeler, a mathematician or a survey designer but was considered one of the principal architects of the second five year plan. Mahalanobis envisioned a robust statistical and data infrastructure for India, working in partnership with the government to enable data driven policymaking. Policy that was influenced by cutting edge contemporary science and authentic data. He and the Indian Statistical Institute were instrumental in leading a campaign to bring computers for electronic data processing in the 1950s, seeing the potential of automated computing ahead of time. And yet India seems to have lost these valuable lessons somewhere along the way.

			    <option value="Healthcare data system in India. Good data is at the heart of public health and public policy. The need for creating resilient data systems is broader than just the pandemic. Resources are not the limiting factor preventing us here. The collective work done by volunteers, spearheading covid19india.org and now covid19bharat.org shows that this is doable on a small scale for a given disease. It is really about leaders promoting the culture of collecting good data, releasing usable individual level data and Meta data for researchers worldwide and having an in house team analysing data in an unbiased and principled way. A well functioning democracy needs a politically neutral, autonomous data system just as much as it needs a strong and independent judiciary system. Through the pandemic, even a quantitatively sophisticated team like ours has not been able to identify critical pieces of data, for example, national level data on cases and deaths broken down by age and sex category. This should be publicly available in a usable format for researchers globally. Web scraping from multiple state and media websites is not sustainable. In the next phase of Covid, when mild cases may continue to happen in the vaccinated and are not likely to be predictive of the total number of severities and deaths, we need to directly track hospital admissions. This will be the leading key metric to roll out and strengthen public health interventions. We have not seen much national level clinical outcome data from Covid. In the absence of such data, we may escalate and intervene with fear even when we may not need to. Data paucity, data opacity and data denial do not help the public or policymakers. Public trust in data is an essential feature of a democracy. Moving Forward How should we go about overhauling the health data system? Many of the high impact Covid papers have been based on the data from Israel, the UK and Denmark. These are countries that have large integrated national healthcare databases. For example, the Chalet health services that is the largest public and semi private health care provider network in Israel. In 2015, Clalit invested in health information technology to manage care through electronic medical records and teleconsultations via smart phones. Israel took the quick call on boosters watching waning data on breakthroughs emerge and possibly saved thousands of lives across the world. When I started my own career, I worked on a population based case control study of colorectal cancer in Israel, recruited through the same Clalit health services. Having an advanced and nimble digital ecosystem helps to improve outcomes across health conditions, not just Covid. There are many alternative models like Public Health England or the Danish national patient registry. What will be a plausible plan for India? I was excited about the newly proposed notion of digital health ID by the government, creating encrypted ID through Aadhaar card, crowdsourcing, surveys, bio banking.

While the data luminosity of India is being rekindled, here is my 2022 wish list Pregnancy is a stressful condition for the mother and also for her growing baby. The body undergoes changes to accommodate the fetus as its own and also acts to ward off infections. Thus the immune mechanism is reset to suppress and at the same time act timely against foreign bacteria or viruses the pregnant woman may encounter. All this is of special concern especially in winters and also against the looming threat of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Make sure that the expecting mother takes a diet rich in vitamin C. It can be found abundantly in Alma, citrus fruits, kiwi and others. This not only helps to boost immunity but also increases the uptake of iron from the diet. Diets rich in antioxidants like nuts should be taken in abundance. These superfunds are immune boosters. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking water helps to keep the body well hydrated from the harsh and dry winters. Drinking soups, juices and a cup or two of tea will help in keeping the body warm. Take the flu shot It is advisable for all pregnant women to take the flu vaccine which not only protects them from major respiratory illnesses but antibodies are transferred to the growing fetus and protects the newborn too as the vaccination cannot be administered until 6 months of age Continue doing regular mild exercises like simple walk help to keep pregnancy blues away and decreases cramps which pregnant women frequently encounter Take adequate rest A sleep of 6 to 8 hours goes a long way in increasing immunity in pregnant women. Don forget to wear warm clothes Pregnant women should keep themselves warm by covering themselves well in this harsh cold especially while stepping out. Keeping body temperature normal helps to boost immunity and prevent infections. Stay away from people who are sick and unwell It is also important for a pregnant woman to stay away from people in the workplace or at home who are having fever, cough or cold as she is more susceptible to catching these infections. Keep your laptop or mobile clean also important to keep surface areas like laptops, mobiles clean from dust and other germs which they may be harboring on their surface to prevent infections. Thus, pregnant women need to be extra cautious during their pregnancy in view of suppressed immunity for their wellbeing and the safety of their unborn child.

Leisure trips have been described, with the headliner smirk topped with a party hat, as revenge travel.

Social media posts documented a new fad: The bank robber chic seen in travel selfies with N95 veils. In chat groups dealing with reunion logistics, pictures of vaccine certificates rolled along with venue details. As we reflect on how we can better our lives in the new year, here is a blueprint to help us lead the kind of life God wishes for us. Our lives should be centred on love for God and love for our fellow beings. When we open our hearts to them and take time to be with those we love, think more about others, and try to show them how we feel. When we radiate warmth and love to all around us, when we are more patient, more tolerant, and more compassionate to others. When we give, give and give to all around us to bring joy and happiness to their lives and to alleviate their burdens. It all begins as we connect with God love through the process of meditation. When we take our attention away from the outer world and focus it within, we are filled with joy and bliss. We are inspired to live a life of service to others and to embrace all we meet as members of the same family of God. Our soul has an existence that is unconstrained by the limitations and boundaries we place on our body, mind and intellect. When we live at the level of our soul, we can transcend the walls of separation and embrace one and all. We develop the godly virtues of truthfulness, nonviolence, selfless service, compassion and humility, and we lead the life that God wishes for us. When we experience the Light of God within us through meditation, we also see the same Light in all people and all life forms. We realize that each person is valuable, being made by God, and carrying God within them. This makes us recognised all life as one human family. development comes when we realise that we are all one. With that realisation, we no longer feel superior to others. We reach a state in which we recognise that all are important. With this elevated vision, we then develop love and respect for all life. We care about others and do not want to see anyone in pain. We become loving, selfless human beings committed to helping others. If each person awakened to the oneness of all life, there would be peace and happiness on the planet. The commodity that is most valued in.">Para 16</option>
			    <option value="The realms beyond this world, to which we all will go, is spiritual love. The soul is measured not by our financial records, but by the amount of love we have radiated to others. Did we love God Did we love our fellow beings Did we love all creation Love is translated into thoughts, words and deeds that are expressed in kindness to others. It is expressed in how much we care about others. It is demonstrated by how much we give of ourselves to help or serve others. It is only when we invert our attention through the process of meditation that we realise our true nature and experience God love. Only when we experience God love can we share this love with others, and only when we share this love and transcend all boundaries do we become truly human. On 20th December 2021, a very crucial bill known as The Prohibition of Child Marriage Amendment Bill, 2021 was introduced in the Look Sabah by Ms. Smite Iran, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, to rise the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years. The statements of Objects and Reasons section of the bill specifies the reasons for raising the minimum marriageable age as women empowerment, gender equality, encouraging female labor participation and self reliance for women. The bill created an uproar in the House due to its contradiction with the personal laws which in turn, has made the Government to refer it to the Parliamentary Standing Committee. However, the opposition and activists have failed to raise the issue of its contradiction with the basic right of every human, that is, to marry at will. The issue is that the Government is now trespassing the boundaries of the personal lives of people to achieve its goals without even realising that its goal cannot be found within those limits. The government has not realised that this attempt would eventually go futile. Rather, the age of marriage for boys set at twenty one is in itself unconstitutional. Let see how. Trespassing the boundaries Infringement of the right to marry at will Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty to every citizen. In Anuj Garg v. Hotel Assn. of India, Supreme Court recognised the right of personal autonomy under Article 21. It was held that it includes both the negative right of not to be subject to interference by others and the positive right of individuals to make decisions about their life. Further, in the case of Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M., it was held that the right to marry out of one own volition is squarely covered under this Article. This infers that the decision as to when that person is ready to marry should be left with the individuals only. Once the person attains the age of majority, that is, eighteen, it is mature enough to make its life decisions. This threshold is recognized for purposes of granting voting.">Para 17</option>
			    <option value="Rights, assuming responsibility for illegal acts, entering into contracts, etc. Thus, there is no iota of doubt as to why an eighteen year old person is not mature enough to marry out of their own volition and free will. A person has an inherent fundamental right to marry at their own discretion any time after attaining the majority. Taking away this fundamental right as a policy decision needs a cogent reason. However, here, the Government has not relied on any research or study which proves that increasing the marriage age would empower women. Goal cannot be found within these boundaries Why would raising the age of marriage eventually fail It is trite to state that the law to prevent child marriage does not work. The marriage age at 18 was set in 1978, but child marriage started to decline only in the 1990s when the government stressed primary education of the girl child and took measures to reduce poverty. It implies that society decides on its own rather than letting the Government decide on the age of marriage. It is clear from the fact that when families in rural areas started losing jobs in the pandemic, child marriages rather increased. The reason is that the factors which induce the families to marry their daughters at an early age still exist and the Government has to not tackle these factors. First, the Government is required to control the socio cultural norms, customs, and beliefs that shape decisions relating to marriageable age in India. In some cultures, women are married at an early age so as to assimilate them from other families into their households. It is believed that an early age at marriage may ensure a bride loyalty to her husband family. A broader spousal age gap would also facilitate this character molding of younger brides, who are likely to be more responsive to these practices. Second, is the economic factor? In resource constrained households, girls may be seen as a liability given the limited economic budget and food security for the entire household. Thus, they believe to pass on these responsibilities onto the husband families as soon as they can. The third is the education factor. No doubt, the families residing in rural areas are more likely to marry their daughters under age. There is usually lower availability and access to schools in rural areas. This may hasten underage marriage. The fourth is the residing area factor. Rural areas offer fewer formal employment opportunities to women. Further, surprisingly, it has been found that higher levels of education are not substantially delaying girls marriage age. In this context, education only becomes an asset for marriage. It suggests that completing secondary school enhances the social position of girls and also their families by improving the chances of marrying into a family of higher socio economic status. So, longer education may also not be improving women status at the household or societal level. Thus, it is clear that raising the marriageable age would.">Para 18</option>
			    <option value="Not change the position of women as expected. Uniform age of 18 for both males and females. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality to both genders. Any differential treatment must be made only upon reasonable criteria otherwise it would be declared discriminatory. Surprisingly, the legal marriageable age is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. The minimum age requirement was introduced to abolish child marriages and to protect children from exploitation. This difference is premised on the assumption that women and men have different growth rates, emotionally, mentally as well as physically. However, this does not qualify as a reasonable criterion. The Supreme Court in the case of has already held that a law that treats women differently based on gender stereotypes is an affront to women dignity. Gender stereotypes cannot qualify as a reasonable criterion and therefore, any legislation made on such criteria is unconstitutional. Thus, a uniform age, more appropriately, 18 should be adopted for both genders. We can conclude safely that for a holistic upliftment of the social status of women, merely raising the minimum age for marriage would not be sufficient until the societal cultures and norms, their educational opportunities, occupational opportunities, and women subordinate status are not taken care of. Merely raising the age of marriage would rather produce an adverse effect as families would now perceive an unmarried daughter as a burden , thereby leading to discrimination. Currently, India relationships with its neighbors are very worrisome especially with China, Pakistan and Nepal which are at very low levels primarily due to the failure on part of Mr. Doval and Jai Shankar to give good counselling to the PM; both of them were regarded as mediocre by their earlier seniors, colleagues and juniors. In this article, a brief history and India relationship with the neighboring countries will be discussed. China is the biggest and the most powerful neighbor. Anytime China did not succeed in diplomatic maneuvers, it resorted to hostility. India also missed a number of opportunities when she could have obtained a very favorable agreement from China. Pandit Nehru could have accepted the offer to be a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council instead of passing the offer to China for which India has paid a heavy price and will continue to do so. Mr. Nehru should have at least made China sign a respectable border deal before passing the offer to China. As per historical records, China did offer a deal to Pandit Nehru, and Nehru was willing to finalize an agreement, however, Shri Rajendra Prasad and Shri Morarji Desai opposed the deal which provided any concession to China. Sardar Patel argued for reaching a settlement but he was ignored. Chinese incursions into India started as early as mid1950s. However, as Shri Nehru was so enthused with Panch Sheel, and Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai, he neither warned China to stop her aggressive moves nor did he make the intrusions public.

In 1962, China attacked India and in spite of earlier assurances by the government of India that India was well prepared to oppose any Chinese aggression, India lost badly. Relationship and contacts between India and China ebbed down to the lowest level after China 1962 was a big betrayal on part of China. Indians became strongly anti China and all meaningful communication between the two countries stopped thereafter. When Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister, he visited China and received a warm welcome there. Zhou Enlai also visited India. In his book about China, Natwar Singh included a draft agreement proposed by Mr. Enlai with an offer to India to make reasonable changes. Both India and China worked on the agreement and ironed out the differences. However, for some unknown reasons, the agreement was never signed and both leaders agreed to maintain the status quo. Chinese encroachments into India and other anti India activities continued. China started supporting Pakistan militarily and economically. China, directly and indirectly, helped Pakistan to acquire nuclear and missile capabilities. China openly supported Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. China always supported Communist Party Marxist of India and later also started supporting Naxalites and Maoists. I suggested some steps to Shri Vajpayee and then to Shri Man Mohan Singh to counter China anti India activities. These included supporting Vietnam economically and militarily, which India has been doing; supporting Tibet liberation movement and Uyghur Muslims; and warming up relationship with Taiwan. Although both the Prime Ministers raised some of these issues with China but were very reluctant to go public and antagonize China too much. When Shri Namenda Mode became the Prime Minister, China approached him for establishing a vibrant business and political relationship. Chinese Prime Minister Xi Jinxing visited Gujarat to celebrate Mode birthday and also expressed his interest in settling the border issues. India could have negotiated a fairly good deal but again did not do so. While taking an amicable approach to India, China started concentrating on increasing its influence in the countries surrounding India. China aid to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Maldives surpassed the economic aid provided by India. China got an agreement with Sri Lanka to build a commercial seaport there which it converted to a military base. When Mrs. Gandhi was the Prime Minister, Sri Lanka had agreed to China having a military base there. Mrs. Gandhi told Sri Lanka government that if the country allowed China to have a military base, Sri Lanka would be wiped off from the world map. Sri Lanka backed off. Still, Mrs. Gandhi was considering occupying Sri Lanka and merging it with India as she had merged Sikkim with India. However, then President Reddy discouraged her from doing so.

Shri Mode made a big mistake by imposing embargo against Nepal which annoyed all Nepalese and pushed Nepal completely into China arms. Nepal also started raising border issues. Things may improve with the upcoming Nepal PM visit to India. For all practical purposes, Bhutan was being run by India. About two years back, China attacked Dolan in Bhutan. After a couple of skirmishes, India backed off to some extent. At that time Bhutanese King requested India to stay away from Bhutan and started a fairly good relationship with China. India is trying again to increase its influence there. A couple of years back, when the virtual dictator of Maldives acquired power, China started pouring money into the Maldives. Maldives imposed a number of restrictions on Indians and India. Then India reinforced its presence and Maldives fell in line with India. Again, in the current election campaign, a political party is seeking votes with the slogan Keep India out. China is increasing its economic power not only in the neighboring countries, it has been doing so in Africa and South America, mainly through its business organizations such as China National Oil Company, HSBC Banks and its infrastructure construction activities is a number of concerns. India government has also done such activities to some extent. However, India government does not have much money of its own to compete with China. India should work with its business organizations. A number of Indian companies such as Tata, Mittal, Reliance, Adana, and Ariel have successfully established themselves in a number of countries. With the help, cooperation and encouragement from the government of India, these companies can compete with Chinese companies in a number of countries. To counter China, India and the USA are trying to develop a common strategy. They also teamed up with Japan and Australia, two economic powers. The four are known as Quad 4 and have been conducting joint military exercises. Can India depend on this Quad 4 in case of war with China No. In case of armed conflict between China and India, the three countries will condemn China but none of them will send an army to help India or attack China. In fact, Russia, which is also apprehensive of China, may stop China from its military venture against India as it did in the past.

While using a carrot, India needs to use a strong and big stick. First, India should enhance and strengthen their military positions on the border and then try to push China from the Indian territory occupied by China. If that is militarily not possible, India should try to capture Chinese territory where the Chinese forces are weak or India is in an advantageous position. The Indian Military should not be withheld from driving China out of Indian territory. At the same time, India should aggressively pursue the above mentioned points which I had conveyed to the two former Prime Ministers. The Indo China border dispute should not be prolonged much longer and needs to be settled soon. In all probability, India could get a good deal from China. If India again misses the opportunity, things will get messier especially after the Winter Olympics in China and India may never get another opportunity to get a favorable deal. India problem of plenty on the external sector too many dollars coming into the country relative to those going out appears to be coming to an end. After nearly two years of ultra accommodative monetary policy, the US Federal Reserve Fed at its December meeting announced it will double the pace of its balance sheet tapering and end its net asset purchases by mid March 2022, three months ahead of its earlier schedule. The median projections also show more front loaded rate hikes in 2022 three hikes and eight cumulative hikes by the end of 2024. Uttarakhand SIT mandated to investigate the hate speech ridden Dharm Sansad at Haridwar and parallel probes by Mumbai and Delhi police into cyber harassment of Muslim women through an app called Bulli Bai are qualified reasons for optimism. But these are just the first steps. Remember that an obnoxious app called ulli Deals featured on the same GitHub platform last year. The Delhi police probe went nowhere. Such policing failures clearly emboldened Bulli Bai creators. Delhi police should be hugely embarrassed, and those behind the app must be unmasked and arrested with chargesheets filed promptly; speedy trial should follow. In the Dharm Sansad case, the local police registered an FIR only after Muslims lodged complaints. But hate speech offences can and should lead to suo motu investigations. A number of Indian Penal Code sections exist to deal with those who threaten violence on other communities and harass women. But only if there is intent to investigate and prosecute these law breakers will these laws serve their purpose as a deterrent.

None of these has seen quick, firm police response. Neither have we heard condemnation from governing politicians. And the result is that such mobs get the sense that the law does apply to them. India police agencies are so heavily under the thumb of their political masters that only government signals, severe judicial strictures or, once in a while, a storm of public criticism can force cops to act in such cases. Now that police forces in three states have initiated probes, there a chance finally that a larger message can be sent to hatemongers and internet communal bullies. Missing this chance will not only further embolden real world and virtual world mobs, it will also do more damage to India reputation, which has taken a lot of recent knocks as far as safety and treatment of minorities are concerned. For India to become one of those countries where majoritarianism becomes an above the law brute force will be a real tragedy. While laying the foundation stone for the Major Dayan Chand Sports University in Meerut, Prime Minister Namenda Modi said young Indians should be encouraged to take up sports as their profession. The thought is good. But the reality is forbidding. Sporting infrastructure in the country remains subpar. True, India just had its best showing at the Olympics when it won seven medals at the Tokyo Games last year, including Neeraj Chopra historic gold in the men javelin event. However, the fact remains that barring cricket other sports in the country lack an ecosystem of professionalism and excellence. Money for nurturing talent rarely gets funnelled to the grassroots where it is needed. Instead, it is mostly directed towards the few top athletes with international medal winning potential. It is no surprise then that Indian parents don see sports as a viable career option for their children. After all, that can only happen if the government is willing to support not just the Neeraj Chopras but also those who fall short of that level of excellence. Money is also required to train coaches, support staff and advisers. This is why countries like the US that are at the apex of international sports have strong sporting cultures in universities that not just produce top ranked athletes but also employ trainers, sports doctors and scientists. But without a similar university set up in India, it is the government that has to think of innovative ways to massively increase funding for sports. One model worth considering is the UK national lottery funding for sports. If sports betting were to be legalised in India and taxed, it would yield substantial funding for creating sports talent hubs across the country. Legalised betting would also check illegal bookmaking and its link to match fixing mafia. So, it is a win win.

Faced with the crisis of the century, we have made many turns, modifying our lifestyle in unimaginable ways. Some of these changes are here to stay. Work from home or, more correctly, work from anywhere, will become a much more accepted norm. While organisations had often balked at the thought of their staff working remotely before the pandemic, the last two years have confirmed that this does not necessarily reduce productivity. Various studies have shown that a hybrid approach that combines work from anywhere with traditional office based work will become the preferred approach with both employees as well as employers. My wife and I decided to get away for two nights to a nice seaside resort and bypass the Covid cobwebs, my treat. I packed a small bag and she lugged down a large suitcase, a smaller case, a handbag and her purse. Like a good husband I held my silence. Checked in and ten minutes into the room she had commandeered 90% of the table with jars, bottles, lotions and creams. Inside the first thirty minutes the bathroom had been usurped. When I finally got in the rod was festooned with washed lingerie and the ledge above the sink was groaning under the weight of her toiletries with 3 inches by 2 inches left for my razor. Isaac Newton was not only an eminent mathematician and physicist but also an erudite philosopher, a deeply spiritual person and a theologian known for Biblical literalism. To most of us, Newton is known for his laws of motion, and there appears to be a striking similarity between these laws and some tenets of Indic philosophy. Newton first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that if a thing is at rest, it will continue to be at rest and if it is in motion, it will continue to be so unless an external force is applied. Inertia is common among people with predominantly tamari tendencies. They can be lazy and indolent, and many times need an external stimulus to get moving. Similarly, those with a hyperactive nature might find it difficult to be at peace with them. So, to bring change in their temperament requires external interventions such as regular physical exercise and meditation. That if the same force is exerted on two objects with different mass, they will gain different speed. The heavier one would require more force to move than the lighter one. Likewise, lazy people would need more prodding and pushing as compared to agile ones. The third law, also known as the law of action and reaction, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Interestingly, this resonates well with the law of karma, which means that whatever action we perform, either good or bad, has a bearing on our destiny.

			    <option value="The country, strengthen citizens sense of the country. This would allow China to indulge in propaganda against the neighboring countries. Fifth, it provides for the border to be sealed in the event of a war, armed conflict, incidents which threaten the security of border residents. India had reacted against the passage of this law realising its implications: China unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implication on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us. It further warned China to avoid undertaking action under the pretext of this law which could unilaterally alter the situation in the India China border areas. It may be pointed out that in the South China Sea, China had indulged in similar action. In April 2020, China had issued new names for 25 islands and reefs and 55 underwater entities in the SCS to assert its claims over them. This was followed by the establishment of two districts to administer Parcel and Spratly in the SCS. The PRC has also passed the Coast Guard Law that authorizes its maritime law enforcement fleets to use lethal force on foreign ships operating in China waters, including the disputed waters claimed by China. That is intended to assert its claims in the nine dash line in the SCS. China not only occupied features, it created artificial islands, which have been weaponries. India has rightly responded by dismissing the Chinese invention. In a statement, the official spokesperson of the ministry said, Arunachal Pradesh has always been, and will always be, an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact. Should India be concerned about this cartographic aggression this deserves to be seen in the context of the Chinese sinister design to first assign Chinese names to geographical entities, then launch propaganda that historically these places belonged to China and then lay claims over them and finally occupy them. Significantly, soon after the naming Xi Jinping in the New Year message talked of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , which is linked with his Chinese Dream to re occupy all the lost territories in the periphery to the forces of imperialism and colonialism. In 2014, Xi projected this dream to its populations which is kept on a diet of ultra nationalism. This betrayed Xi ulterior motive. China usually acts aggressively when it perceives threat to its territory. This perception is more often the product of its own propaganda. After sometime, the CPC starts believing that these regions belong to China. This is exactly what we have seen in the South China Sea, where it is claiming 90% of the area demarcated by its nine dash line. There is another pressure on Xi to act. Internationally, the mistrust about China has increased considerably during the pandemic period. Besides, dissidence in the country is also growing. As the criticism against Xi is growing, he is under pressure to.">Para 25</option>
			    <option value="Show some progress towards the achievement of the Chinese Dream, particularly, when CPC is celebrating its centenary. It is no wonder that China has adopted a more aggressive tone and activities, threatening the stability of the region. China is also constructing a number of villages along the Arunachal Pradesh border in an attempt to solidify its claims. Arunachal Pradesh is called as Hangman or the Southern Tibet by China and is shown as the Chinese territory in its maps. The renaming of places is a part of the Chinese mischief to claim these geographical entities, which include eight residential areas, four mountains, two rivers, and a mountain pass as per the CPC mouth piece Global Times. While these do not materially impact on India, it is a challenge to India sovereignty and integrity. India options are limited to stymie any aggressive move by China. A two dimensional strategy for this needs to be carefully worked out. First, there is a need to counter such false propaganda based, more forcefully perhaps on a continuing basis, so that the policy making center does not start believing in its own fabricated propaganda. This has to take into account the Chinese three warfare stratagem that includes psychological warfare, media warfare and law fare. India needs to establish a group comprising all the stakeholders to work out details as has been done by China. Second, the support to self rule in China should be extended. China is contesting not only the McMahon Line but the interior parts of India. India needs to understand clearly that these Chinese acts would not have happened had Tibet been an independent country. The Chinese occupation of Tibet has made China our neighbor and now we are facing their sinister designs. Currently, there is enhanced international support to the Central Tibetan Administration Tibet Govt. in Exile. China decisions to incise the Tibetan culture and ruthlessly repressing the Tibetans have generated a strong criticism. At the 14 the session of the UN Forum on minority issues met in early December 2021, the deteriorating conditions of the Tibetans were brought out clearly. The US in its report has also observed that CCP is imposing its ideology to ensure the loyalty of the Tibetans to the state. The US has appointed a Special Representative to remain in touch. The Chinese attempts to appoint the successor of the Dalai Lama is viewed as an encroachment on the Tibetan religious affairs. In other countries too, the Tibetans are organizing protests on the Chinese atrocities. Last year in March, the Free Tibet supporters came out in streets of Paris to mark the 62 ND anniversary of the uprising against the Chinese rule. Slogans like Coronavirus made in China, Shame on Xi Jinping, We want Freedom, and Free Tibet was raised. Similarly in UK, the Tibetan community organized protests in February last year.

In a quote popularly attributed to Abraham Lincoln, including by many current US lawmakers and politicians, the country 16th President is said to have warned that America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves. As it turns out, archivists and historians have lately determined that the quote is an oversimplified paraphrase from an even more prescient observation Lincoln made in an address in 1838 on the threats to American institutions. In what is now considered his first great speech, made to Young Men Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois nearly 23 years before the Civil War, Lincoln said: Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide. Into the third year of the pandemic, governments the world over now have the benefit of experience to shape responses to a surge in infections. In India, the second wave during the 2021 summer was a searing experience. No less important in terms of imparting lessons was the fallout of a nationwide lockdown the year before. All these experiences need to be brought together as states and municipal corporations prepare to cope with the third wave of Covid infections. The inflection point in the current surge took place last week when the daily caseload increased by 46 in a day to touch 9,184 on December 28. The rise since has been exponential and the national daily caseload reached 58,097 between January 4 and 5. It has been accompanied by a jump in daily positivity rate to 4.18 from just 0.73 a month ago. Many states have responded by curbing mobility, the most blunt instrument available in their toolkit. Delhi has a night curfew in place which will be supplemented by a weekend curfew. Tamil Nadu too has opted for a night curfew along with a full lockdown on Sundays.">Para 27</option>
			    <option value="West Bengal government has limited flights from Delhi and Mumbai to three a week. The ongoing surge in infections is happening in a context that has important differences when compared to the second wave. Around 65 of the adult population is fully vaccinated and over 8 million children in the 1518 age group have been administered a single dose. Moreover, we have the benefit of observing the trajectory of the Omicron variant in other countries. The combined impact of these differences calls for a more sophisticated approach by state governments. Resorting to partial curfews and lockdowns will impose a disproportionate cost on the most economically vulnerable segments and not really curb infections. The primary aim for governments is to ensure that the healthcare infrastructure does get overwhelmed. When seen in this context, Maharashtra approach makes sense. Media reports indicate the state is inclined to use Covid bed vacancy as a measure to choose policy options. A smarter approach along with tighter enforcement of masking rules and capacity restrictions in public spaces will help states strike a fine balance between controlling the spread of infections and limiting its economic fallout. India can neither afford to let its healthcare infrastructure collapse nor impose lockdowns. The current surge needs to be managed by a smarter set of tools.

Polarisation coaxed by technology and particularly social media can be more extreme than any physical ghettoisation, and this is true across the world. For all the homilies that adults spin about the young as architects of a better future, this case, even if it an uncommon case, is a grim lesson that toxic input produces similar output.

It has a certain utility, but the useless has no limitation to it. What is the use of a rose flower No use, but life would be very empty without rose flowers. What is the use of laughter it is not a commodity; it does not feed people. If you are hungry, it will not help. If you are ill, it will not help, it is not medicine. If you are fighting with somebody it will not help, it is not an atom bomb. Of what use is laughter that why the people who look at life with the eyes of a utilitarian don laugh. They don love because what use is love to them it is wastage, a wastage of energy, time, life. To them it is stupid because it is useless. They earn money rather than falling in love, because money is useful. Love has no utility, but love has grandeur and splendor. Without love what is life of what utility is meditation sometimes people come to me, and they ask, what will we get out of meditation they are thinking of getting some profit, they want some result. And I say to them, you are not going to get anything out of it. Meditation is not a means to some end; it is an end unto itself that why it has no utility.

Now if you invent something, a gadget, you can patent it and you can earn money out of it. But if you write a beautiful poem, you can earn any money out of it; it is just wastage. People ask, what are you doing why are you wasting your life but writing poetry, if you really have been into it, is a great joy in itself. Nothing else is needed, you are already rewarded. No other extrinsic reward is going to make any difference to you. The reward is inward, intrinsic; it arises out of the activity.

Armed Forces Special Powers Act was brought into the administrative and legal arena in 1958 in the NE through an ordinance and later to receive Parliamentary sanction to a series of Acts created by the Indian Parliament that empowers Armed Forces to maintain public order in disturbed areas, to gain grip on deteriorating law & order situation, more or less, in all seven states. The ordnance was then subsequently put through certain legal embellishments and trappings and reintroduced in 1972 in all seven sister states of NE. The same Act was also placed into operations in the state of Punjab in 1983 and later in J&K in Jul 1990. It is noteworthy that the Act conceptualized is a piece of colonial origin which was conceived in 1942 and was left invalidated in 1957 only to be put into operations in 1958 when the Government of the day found law & order and secessionism as the growing ailments in new state i.e., India.
