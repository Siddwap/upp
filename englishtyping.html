                        <option value="Pressure of successful recruitment on organizations is making the HRs adopt modern practices to ensure fairness and efficiency in the hiring process. From identifying the right channel to source the desired candidate and potentially fast-tracking them through proper recruitment and onboarding procedures, HRs are looking at optimizing the entire process and cost. A successful and organized recruitment procedure can assist in finding a talent aligned with the brand values, culture, and purpose. Due to the onset of the pandemic, the majority of hiring processes have moved to virtual space, integrating advanced technologies. Organizations are deploying new-age strategies that not only expedite the hiring process but also eliminate bias in assessing candidates and provide insights for data-driven decision-making. Adopting a digitised approach Technology has become an indispensable part of every function and it has replaced the manual process with automated ones. Similarly, talent managers also need to adopt an automated approach when it comes to hiring with efficiency. Embedding technology tools can replace their repeated mundane tasks without requiring their valuable time and skills to be wasted on manual execution. Unfortunately, several organizations still require their employees to spend hours completing time-consuming tasks. By automating the recruitment process, talent managers can spend more time analyzing the candidates data and finding the ones with requisite skills. Expanding the horizon to remote workers Prior to the pandemic, it was hard for organizations to think about having full-time remote workers. However, the overnight shifting of office work to virtual space has settled the remote work challenges and concurred that having a remote workforce is possible. As a result, talent managers now get a larger pool of potential candidates because geography no longer remains a barrier. In addition, it also contributes to an organisation diversity, equity and inclusion policy by having employees belonging to different territories and cultures. Establishing a leadership culture Promoting a sense of ownership in employees breeds leaders of tomorrow. Hence, designing a strategy that empowers the culture of leadership within the company can help talent managers attract better talent in the industry. Superior talent in an organisation gives new wings to business. This can be nurtured by providing innovative leadership training to employees who can further provide a competitive edge to the organisation. Therefore, exhibiting ownership culture and high-performance variability can prove to be a game-changer in building a stronger workforce. Considering internal mobility Depending on external knowledge and sources remains top of the mind of talent managers while finding the much-needed skills. However, this strategy can be time-consuming as well as expensive. Talent managers often overlook the internal promotions or benefit of internal mobility in filling up open positions. As a robust hiring solution, talent managers must leverage the existing relationship in their existing employee base that can accelerate productivity with much efficiency. As per the data companies that leverage internal mobility reportedly retained employees for 5.4 years. Adopting employee flexibility No candidate wants to join a workplace where employees feel exhausted. Talent managers must explore ways to offer flexibility.">Para 1</option>

Following this policy Gandhi supported the Khilafat Movement, a divisive movement which turned into a communal movement culminating into genocide of Hindus in Malabar. It is noteworthy that Khilafat Movement was opposed by Jinnah whereas Mauling Abu Kalama Azad had supported it. The genocide of hapless Hindus prompted Dr. Hedge war conceives an organization of Hindus. This led to the formation of RSS in 1925. Now that RSS has grown into a force to reckon with, the present Chief of RSS, Dr. Mohan Bhagwat has embarked on the mission to bring the Muslim Community into the mainstream which Congress did not do in pursuit of its narrow political interest or rather alienated the community. With the response he is getting from the intelligentsia and certain sections of the Muslim Community, it is hoped, the bond between the Hindus & Muslims will be strengthened, who have for generations lived harmoniously. Today, with the complexity of designs that we witness worldwide, a digital uprising is very critical. As architects and designers, we must actively invest in newer technology and innovations with in the construction industry to allow stakeholders to save time and money and go paperless in the long run, moving towards environmental sustainability. Modern-day structures are a combination of various interconnected elements and resultants of complex calculations. Ensuring this momentous task is carried out with utmost precision requires a blend of competencies and digital aid. The adoption of various technologies in construction works can enable professionals to save time, improve the quality of work, reduce costs, focus on safety parameters, and increase profit margins. Digitisation can also streamline business models and practices with proper tracking measures, thereby providing transparency and allowing us to collect data, track materials and working hours for effective planning. Incorporating technology also boosts productivity, increases efficiency and reduces project delivery time as communication on projects improves, reducing the scope for confusion and errors. In the present day, continually evolving technology has further strengthened the usage of digital tools such as BIM a popular tool with integrated design practices. This has enabled architecture and engineering to streamline and improve on the lines of quality, accuracy and innovation. Additionally, various 3D integrated design and analysis is software have made construction operations easier by carrying out complex simulations. As a result, such software and tools have become widely popular among architects and designers. Digitised Operations Embracing the Change The construction industry consists of many organizations that are either unprepared for or overwhelmed by the magnitude of new and emerging technologies. The increasing desire for organizations to switch to digital operations is further reinforced by their intent to limit the usage of resources such as paper. This saves enormous printing costs, precious time and storage in a modern-day workspace. In addition, information management.">Para 2</option>
                        <option value="And knowledge transfer have become a swift process with digitised operations. But, the major challenge the construction industry faces today is smoother communication amongst different stakeholders in the timely completion of projects. Projects are dynamic and often require numerous changes and modifications throughout their lifecycle, especially from the schematic to the completion stage. While we have all progressed towards utilising digital platforms for smooth communication and managing documentation and timeline through various platforms, there still needs to be a seamless integration of everything that is dynamic and acts as a way of communication amongst different stakeholders. This calls for a dire need for digital transformation in the construction sector, especially post-pandemic, with a digitally enabled workforce. Globally, the adoption of technology has enabled firms offering design and construction services to identify inefficiencies, curate an implementation strategy and employ the right personnel. By incorporating advanced technology, integrated practices offering design and engineering consultation seek to increase profitability, streamline processes, reduce project risks, and bring efficiency in their design coordination by pre-empting clashes in design and providing value addition to the designed product. Boosting productivity with technology In the era of pursuing integrated operations, collaboration becomes paramount. Architects use technology platforms such as BIM, allowing effective collaboration with engineers and contractors regarding the designs of projects. With the growing popularity of BIM modeling, using 3D modeling software has become a must for Government projects in certain countries and is increasingly being requested for private projects of all sizes. In regards to ensuring a hazard-free work environment, Augmented Reality (AR)provides an overlay of digital information on top of the real world. Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) allows software access to phones, thus reducing the usage of high-end laptops and desktops for real-time updates. Additionally, Virtual Reality (VR) enables designers to model structures and simulate them as per various real-world scenarios. Using drones for inspections and surveys cuts down the time involved and the usage of resources. Similarly, the Internet of Things (Iota) manages a plethora of technology and optimizes the use of resources with effective planning and connecting everyone on the team. The future of the Indian built environment has tremendous potential to develop complex structures in challenging environments with diverse social and climatic conditions. The economic narrative on projects must allocate room for enabling state-of-the-art technology on large-scale projects. With multiple stakeholders involved in a project, time management becomes a necessity making collaboration the key to operating in the industry. Technology, when used to its utmost potential, can enable communication to increase between the field and the office. Additionally, real-time data allows plans, permits and other documents to get submitted and approved faster, ensuring supreme project delivery. Therefore, a switch to digital operations with all the costs involved seems a justified move in the industrial context. To win the race of accelerated digitalization, organizations are constantly evolving their hiring strategies. As the crisis unfolds, these organizations are buckling down to refine their hiring process and win the war of talent. Further, the tremendous.">Para 3</option>
                        <option value="Regarding the impact of automation, the increase in productivity of manufacturing processes with declining manpower demands cannot be ruled out. The increasing intervention of machines in the handling of various activities in all sectors contributing to the economy is bound to affect the manual requirements adversely. However, this is opening new vistas for developing automated and intelligent systems with the involvement of human intelligence and efforts. Challenges The collective endeavour for getting things done using machines and their automatic is culminating in intelligent digital systems with the ability to remain productive without human involvement. There is an obvious replacement of many persons by infusing artificial intelligence into digital manufacturing systems. The loss of jobs on account of such transformations is prominently upon the shop floor jobs. Robots replacing humans for doing certain tasks are ubiquitous in various industries. For example, automation in the food industry, agriculture, construction sector, health sector for operating healthcare machines, medical robots, multipurpose robots, autonomous vehicles, unmanned operations, etc. are gradually eliminating the manpower requirements. To elaborate further, let us realize how automation has replaced manpower in the food industry where technological advancements have paved the way for mechanized preparation of ingredients for cooking, recipe-based automatic cooking, machines for cleaning utensils, robots for lifting and placing items, services like waiters, etc. Why doctors are required for the diagnosis of disease and prescribe a line of treatment if a similar symptom-based diagnosis is carried out using an interactive software application? Hospitals are heavily relying on technology in extending health services. The reliance on washing machines, mopping machines, cleaning machines, surveillance systems, etc. has undoubtedly eased life and reduced dependence on domestic helps. The complete agriculture value chain and agriculture business is changing on the premise of low labor input and high yield using technological support. In the education sector, the new norm of online blended teaching and self-oriented learning is likely to incur a huge loss of jobs across the world. These are a few instances to perceive the ensuing challenges from the ongoing automation. This has yielded in increasing production of robots for specific purposes by robot manufacturers and the deployment of industrial robots is increasing every day. In the specific context of India which is blessed with demographic dividend and has an abundance of young population, the reports indicating the likelihood of loss of 69% of jobs due to automation is discomforting for policymakers. Declining labor demand for medium-skill occupations and imbalance in demand for low and high-skill occupations emanating into exacerbating wage disproportionateness is perturbing for the nations having a mammoth size of population seeking jobs. The situation is equally distressing in developed economies too like those of China, the USA, Japan, South Korea, etc. Opportunity: Automation has effectuated in cyber-physical systems as part of Industry 4.0.

                        <option value="Therefore, to remain efficient, competitive and sustainable, businesses must invest in modernising and empowering their legal departments. What, then, is legal transformation? Introduction of technology in legal departments also benefits the business whole, from ensuring business continuity to complying with laws, improving business environment, finalizing contracts, protecting business interests, etc. Hence, many legal departments have undergone a transformation to improve their own operations. Legal Transformation is amalgamating people, processes and data under one umbrella to support legal operations and to significantly improve the way legal departments function. It also enables the organisation to function effortlessly in the new external environment of the day by unifying the various sub functions of the legal department and integrating it with the rest of the organisation. Legal transformation typically involves three steps. Shifting from manual to digital operations across the entire legal function. Digitising and automating cross functional and external coordination. mplementing a system of centralised data, document handling and workflows The key advantage of digitisation and technology in the legal function is more efficient, easier, faster and simpler operational processes enabling faster yet simpler business. Technology enables people to connect faster and collaborate better, enabling simpler ways to doing business. This involves, in a birds eye view, connecting all the constituent functions of corporate legal departments in a single platform, called Enterprise Legal Management ELM. This is a system which connects the entire contract management, matter management, compliances, legal spend etc. seamlessly, while also integrating these with the organisational systems. Outlining and planning the change It is imperative to chart the current status of the processes, operations and data formats of the organisation are they fully manual, or have some basic automation been done? What are the interconnections with other departments and external parties? The organisational strategy and current challenges have also to be considered. These two will enable the charting of the precise steps to be undertaken, a prioritised list of the pain points of the organisation. Prioritisation is essential so that the change is smooth, and does not hamper current operations. For example, if the key challenge is the back end onboarding of new partners is taking time in a fast moving unicorn startup, the first step could be a savvy rapid online onboarding processes including, self service contracting; this enables smooth and fast onboarding of all stakeholders. Alternatively, the pain point could be regulatory compliance in a highly regulated industry. This is the second level of transformation, wherein the key pain point has been addressed now the task is to proceed and incorporate technology throughout the legal function. In the example above, it could include standard templatised contracts, documents, a centralised repository of all contracts and documents, as well as Real time online Compliance and Entity management systems to ensure the company is fully compliant and up to date with the regulations meaning further risk reduction and business agility. One can also have an up to date centralised legal matter management module ensures dispute management, keeping the risks further on.">Para 7</option>
